- The code is a VHDL implementation of a top-level entity that creates two counters: a fast counter and a slow counter.
- The entity has a generic input value 'n' that determines the bit width of the counters, as well as input ports for reset signal 'rst', clock signal 'clk', 
and an upper bound value for the slow counter 'upperBound'.
-The output of the entity is the countOut signal, which provides the value of the counters.
- The fast counter process updates its count value on each rising edge of the clock signal and 
resets to zero when the reset signal is activated or when it reaches the value of the slow counter.
- Both counters use an XOR gate and an AND gate to generate the next count value.
-The slow counter process updates its count value on each rising edge of the clock signal and 
resets to zero when the reset signal is activated or when it exceeds the upper bound value.
- Both counters use variables to store the current count value, as well as a carry variable 
to perform the logic operations.
- The code demonstrates the basic principles of counter design in VHDL, including the use
 of processes and variables, and the manipulation of binary values using logic gates.
